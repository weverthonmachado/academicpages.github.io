I'm a PhD candidate in Sociology at the [Institute of Social and Political Studies](http://www.iesp.uerj.br/en/) of the Rio de Janeiro State University. During the 2017-2018 academic year, I'm also Visiting Graduate Researcher at the [California Center for Population Research/UCLA](https://ccpr.ucla.edu), under a Fulbright scholarship.

My research interests include marriage, family and inequality. 

I'll have some content here...eventually. Meanwhile, you can reach me at weverthon[at]iesp[dot]uerj[dot]com.
